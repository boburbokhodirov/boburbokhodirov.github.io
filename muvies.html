    			<li><strong>Storyline:</strong> In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states</br> fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly</br> outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of </br>history. Persian King Xerxes led a Army of well over 100,000 (Persian king Xerxes </br>before war has about 170,000 army) men to Greece and was confronted by 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians,</br> and 400 Thebans. Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to </br>surrender or withdraw but left with no options he pushed forward. After 3 days of </br>battle all the Greeks were killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected, as a </br>local shepherd, named Ephialtes, defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes that </br>the separate path through Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the </br>Greeks, was not as heavily guarded as they thought.</li>
